It is founded on the philosophy of Pharmaceutical Care, and may encompass an array of services, whereby the pharmacist employs a systematic patient-centered approach to define and achieve goals related to optimal pharmacotherapy. The MTM series of courses will be delivered longitudinally over three years of the undergraduate program, with MTM 1 being the first of the four-part course series. MTM 1 will allow students to begin to apply knowledge and develop skills needed to undertake MTM, with content drawn from co-requisite and pre-requisite courses. Lecture and laboratory sessions will be designed to facilitate guided, independent, and collaborative learning. A key element of MTM 1 is that students will have the opportunity to undertake the role of a pharmacist in a simulated community practice and will be responsible for various tasks such as conducting patient interviews, assessing the appropriateness of pharmacotherapy, providing medication-related patient education, actively participating in the medication-dispensing process, responding to drug information queries from patients and health care providers, documenting pharmacotherapeutic recommendations, and interpreting the pharmacist’s ethical and legal obligations within provincial and federal regulatory frameworks. This course will introduce and develop fundamental knowledge, skills and attitudes intrinsic to the pharmacy student’s professional identity development; these attributes will be transferable to diverse practice settings, and prepare students for their first year early experiential rotation.</p></div></div><span class="views-field views-field-field-prerequisite"><strong class="views-label views-label-field-prerequisite">Prerequisite: </strong><span class="field-content"><a href="/course/PHM110H1">PHM110H1</a>; <a href="/course/PHM113H1">PHM113H1</a>; <a href="/course/PHM130H1">PHM130H1</a></span></span><br><span class="views-field views-field-field-corequisite"><strong class="views-label views-label-field-corequisite">Corequisite: </strong><span class="field-content"><a href="/course/PHM101H1">PHM101H1</a>; <a href="/course/PHM114H1">PHM114H1</a>; <a href="/course/PHM141H1">PHM141H1</a></span></span></div>

As health care providers, pharmacists discern and translate both the quality and relevance of health information with the goal of optimizing patient outcomes. This course introduces students to clinical trial designs typically used in health care. The course will explore core principles in experimental and non-experimental research designs. The focus will be on randomized controlled trials as they are the primary method of generating evidence for therapeutic interventions. Students will learn how various research approaches are selected, designed, executed, analyzed, published and applied (including critical appraisal). The course covers a broad range of research topics at the introductory to intermediate level. Students will develop foundational knowledge and skills in research methods, statistics and ethics that will be applied in pharmacotherapy modules.</p></div></div></div>

This course is also designed to give students a broad overview in collaborative leadership theory so that they are better prepared to work effectively in their chosen field. Students will learn how pharmacy practice in different settings has evolved from 1985 to 2000 to 2015 as well as how practice may evolve in the future. In doing so students will develop a greater appreciation of the skills required to deliver effective patient care-focused services. Overall, the aim of this course is to equip students with the ability to apply their clinical, pharmaceutical and management skills to provide high quality services that are patient focused and demonstrate value for money.</p></div></div><span class="views-field views-field-field-prerequisite"><strong class="views-label views-label-field-prerequisite">Prerequisite: </strong><span class="field-content"><a href="/course/PHM110H1">PHM110H1</a></span></span></div>

The rotation will build on knowledge, skills and behaviours acquired in academic courses and earlier experiential rotations throughout the curriculum. This rotation will occur in sites serving a variety of health care needs, including, for example, acute care, rehabilitation, pediatric, geriatric, chronic care and specialty populations. Care may be provided in any patient care setting such as a hospital, family health team, community pharmacy, ambulatory clinic or other types of patient care practices, with an emphasis on establishing a context for the provision of pharmaceutical care in a clinical setting. Students will participate in, and take responsibility for, direct patient care activities including: patient assessment to identify and prioritize drug therapy problems, development of care plans that address desired patient outcomes, and patient monitoring including physical and laboratory assessment, and where feasible, provision of follow-up evaluation and appropriate documentation. Students will communicate with patients and care givers to monitor patient parameters, determine and assess target outcomes, and provide education. Students will work closely with members of the health care team in providing collaborative care, with regular communication with team members to share and document their assessment of the patient’s medication related needs and recommendations to address those needs.</p></div></div></div>

This course is designed to build and enhance students’ knowledge and skills necessary for contemporary and future pharmacy practice in the area of self-care and minor ailments. This course will cover the management of conditions not covered in other courses and will provide the students’ with a comprehensive understanding of non-prescription and prescription therapeutics as they relate to patient self-medication and minor ailments. Emphasis will be placed on the role and responsibility of the pharmacist in accurately assessing and triaging patients, determining the appropriate use of non-prescription and prescription drugs, by determining when to follow-up, refer, and how to document the patient’s care. The student will be equipped with the clinical skills, confidence, and tools needed to gather and convey reliable minor ailment information to patients and healthcare providers in an effort to effectively and confidently assess and treat patients. With this knowledge and a structured framework for conducting a minor ailments assessment, students will be able to help patients make appropriate decisions and achieve optimal outcomes from their selected, evidence-based therapy. The main course material will be presented as case-based didactic lectures; student participation in class discussions and interactive classroom activities will be expected. There will be an opportunity for application of the concepts discussed in lectures via simulated patient counselling activities, case-based group learning, and self-directed activities.</p></div></div><span class="views-field views-field-field-prerequisite"><strong class="views-label views-label-field-prerequisite">Prerequisite: </strong><span class="field-content"><a href="/course/PHM105H1">PHM105H1</a>; <a href="/course/PHM205H1">PHM205H1</a>; <a href="/course/PHM206H1">PHM206H1</a>; <a href="/course/PHM305H1">PHM305H1</a></span></span></div>
