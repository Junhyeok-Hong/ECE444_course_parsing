KPE400H1,"Ethics & Power in Kinesiology, Physical Education and Health Fields",,"The major presupposition of this course is that graduates who pursue careers in the broad fields of kinesiology, physical education and health – teaching, fitness and lifestyle counseling, coaching, medicine, health sciences or research – will be in positions of social responsibility and leadership in society. This course will initiate discussions about developing decolonial ethics through three intersecting dimensions: (a) the importance of reflection, vulnerability, and nonjudgmental communication, (b) the necessity to resist domination and colonial forces, and (c) the work needed to create new, alternative relationships. We take up the challenge of courageously creating ethical spaces and developing an ethical self that can respond intellectually, politically and personally to ethical dilemmas in social, political and cultural life. Selected theories and case studies will be examined, analyzed, and evaluated.","['KPE100H1', 'KPE200H1', 'Complicated']",,,
KPE401H1,International Development through Sport,,"Increasingly, sport and physical activity are recognized and utilized as tools of international development. From refugee assistance and conflict resolution to programs targeting economic growth and HIV/AIDS, a host of development initiatives use sport-based programs to meet their goals. The purpose of this course is to examine—theoretically, empirically, and critically—the development through sport / sport for development and peace (DTS / SDP) movement. It is important to consider these social and political issues in order both to problematize the DTS movement and to assist and challenge future DTS volunteers.",['KPE200H1'],,,
KPE403H1,"Gender/s, Sexualities and Sport",,"This course will examine historical and contemporary conceptions and experiences of gender/s and sexualities in sport and physical culture. We will address the complexities of gender/s and sexualities paying attention to how normativity and intersectionality (e.g., how gender and sexuality intersect with race, colonialism, class, disability) enable and constrain people’s sense of belonging in sport and physical activity. Discourses, representations and practices of masculinity, femininity, homophobia, heterosexism, and homonormativity are interrogated using feminist, post-colonial and anti- oppression theories. Drawing from key critical literatures, film/documentaries, policy and research, we will consider the ways in which gender/s and sexualities have been governed in sports and physical culture, and how differential power relations continue to shape people’s understanding of, and attitudes towards, gender-non-conforming bodies, athletes and activists in sport and physical activity, and limit what is possible for LGBTQ+ individuals and communities. We will consider what needs to be done to create the conditions in which participation in sport and physical activity enables the kind of social justice, caring and ethical relations though which a multiplicity of gender and sexuality identifications are allowed to flourish.","['KPE100H1', 'KPE200H1']",,,
KPE404H1,"Illness, Disease and Physical Culture",,"This senior course in physical cultural studies attends to and examines the existential and cultural dimensions of illness, disease and suffering in society. Taking both the personal (i.e., embodied, emplaced and performative) experience and institutional organization of illness as its broad focus, the course theoretically and empirically interrogates how socially problematic forms of embodiment, self-constructions through disease processes, illness and individual affect, strained interpersonal relations through illness, bodies in physical and social recovery, and cultural representations of ‘bad bodies’ are poorly understood within kinesiology proper. Particular attention in this course is given to how bodies and associated selves at the fringe of medically defined ‘health’/kinesiological parameters are positioned as pathological, contra-normative, at risk or in need of repair and restitution. Central theoretical and conceptual questions regarding what constitutes health and wellbeing are addressed against the lived cultural realities of people with movement and physical activity challenges and limitations. Topics in the course may include, but are not limited to, doing physical activity as a diseased person, the social organization of rehabilitative medicine in sport and physical cultures, athletes living with/recovering from physical trauma and mental illnesses, patient-centered movement cultures, and phenomenological accounts of the illness, disease and dying processes.","['KPE100H1', 'KPE200H1', 'KPE290H1', 'KPE291H1']",,,
KPE405H1,"Race, Indigeneity and Physical Culture",,"In this course we will refer to race as a remnant of colonialism, an effect of social practices, and a shifting, performed identity. We explore the ways that fantasies of the history of Canada as a tolerant and multicultural nation hide truths about racism in this country and construct race and indigeneity in everyday life. This course examines how and why ’race’ matters so intensely and the ways ‘race’ is produced and policed, ultimately enabling and empowering some bodies and movements, while oppressing others within physical cultures. Myths of race as a biological category will be debunked. We will explore a wide range of topics including Black masculinities and Black diasporas, access to sport for Asians and anti-Asian racism, the (in)visibility of Indigenous peoples in Canadian sport; religious (in)tolerance, and White privilege. We will read theoretical and empirical chapters and articles and discuss how socio-economic, ableist, and gendered practices of differentiation produce race categories. Last, we will elaborate our roles in creating more equitable and democratic spaces for all athletes and people. KPE405H1 will not only improve engagement with social justice issues, but also ameliorate communication skills and intercultural competencies particularly related to indigeneity, diaspora, equity, and anti-racism in sport.",['KPE200H1'],,,
KPE407H1,Maltreatment in Youth Sport,,"Participation in sport for youth has been associated with physical, social, emotional, and cognitive benefits. The attainment of positive developmental outcomes through sport participation is influenced by factors including the manner in which sport organizations design and deliver programs and the type of relationships youth experience. Although sport participation for youth has the potential to foster developmental benefits, not all youth have positive sport experiences. In fact, as issues of athlete maltreatment in youth sport, including physical, emotional, and sexual abuse as well as neglect continue to emerge throughout research and media outlets, it may be argued that sport is not designed and delivered in ways that meet the psychosocial needs of young people. In order to optimize the sport experiences of youth athletes, it is important that stakeholders are aware of the potential for these negative experiences and are educated about ways in which to foster more developmentally appropriate sport. In this course students will be introduced to concepts, theories and ideologies regarding psychosocial development as well as youth maltreatment and protection as they apply to sport. Students will have the opportunity to critically discuss issues of maltreatment within youth sport and will be challenged to critique present research in addition to educational/policy initiatives intended to safeguard youth and foster positive development. Moreover, students will learn about organizational philosophies, coach and parent education, and relationships in sport with the intention of understanding how such factors may stimulate a youth sport environment conducive to maltreatment, thus hindering athletes’ psychosocial needs.",['KPE220H1'],,,
